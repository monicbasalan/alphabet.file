<br>
<br>			<img src="images/q1.jpg" alt="Img" height="542" width="868">
<br>
<br>Most people hold this very wrong notion about spa treatments! They have a tendency to restrict it to facials and body massages only! But in reality, spas have a much broader variety of treatments. Let us have a quick look below!
<br>
<br><b><font color=maroon>Facial Treatments</font></b>
<br>
<br><img src="images/q2.jpg" alt="Img" height="442" width="568">
<br>
<br>Facials are treatments that involve cleansing, scrubbing, steaming, application of masks, peeling, nourishing and massaging the delicate facial skin. They help to get rid of the dull and flaky dead cells of upper most layer of the skin. The massage on the other hand, improves blood circulation, clears away clogged filthy pores and rehydrates the skin. Certain facials emphasize on curing specific issues such as pimple and acne, dark circles and puffiness beneath the eyes, anti ageing etc., while others focus on the overall health of the facial skin.
<br>
<br><b><font color=maroon>Body Treatments</font></b>
<br>
<br><img src="images/q3.jpg" alt="Img" height="442" width="568">
<br>
<br>Spas offer a wide range of treatments for the body: such as body polishes, Vichy showers, aqua therapies, body wraps etc. In case of aqua therapy, one takes a refreshing dip in aqua-jet tubs, with aromatherapy oils for moisturization and relaxation. This process improves circulation and hydrates the skin. Body polishes are equivalent to body facials. The body is scrubbed to remove the dead skin cells and leave it feeling smooth and supple. It normally ends with a good round of cream massage to replenish the skin’s lost moisture. Salt scrubs are the commonest form of body polishes, where the experts make use of sea salt for exfoliation. After the body has been scrubbed, the body is covered either with seaweed or semi moist mud to help extract the unwanted impurities from the skin and even out the rough surface to improve the skin texture. The body is cleansed thereafter and a generous amount of lotion is massaged into the skin. Vichy showers are sometimes used to indicate the end of a polish or a wrap, but <br>they can be chosen alone as well. These showers have many small shower heads sprinkling water on you as you are made to lie on a cushioned table. This too helps in blood circulation as well as hydration.
<br>
<br><b><font color=maroon>Massages</font></b>
<br>
<br><img src="images/q4.jpg" alt="Img" height="442" width="568">
<br>
<br>Massages are the most widespread form of spa treatments, with a large number of variations. A hot stone massage combines warmth and coolness that helps the body to heal and detoxify. This also enhances lymph flow and helps flush out waste. A Swedish massage is the commonest form of massage. It involves long strokes of muscles and tissues with light or medium pressure. This is mostly used for pure relaxation purposes. Chair massage is a kind of seated massage that is pretty short and focuses on your shoulders, neck, arms and back. Deep tissue massage is a type of massage therapy that mainly stresses on realigning deeper layers of muscles and tissues. Some of the same strokes are used as classic massage therapy, but the movement is a lot slower and the pressure applied is the highest. Trigger point massage therapy is particularly offered to mollify the root point of the pain by repeated series of pressure and release.
<br>
<br><b><font color=maroon>Nail Treatments</font></b>
<br>
<br><img src="images/q5.jpg" alt="Img" height="442" width="568">
<br>
<br>Nowadays we have spa treatments in the form of manicures and pedicures too. Other than reshaping and polishing the nails, the aestheticians will also exfoliate the cuticles, soften them, and also offer paraffin treatments along with warm cream or hot-stone massages.
<br>
<br><b><font color=maroon>Hair Removal</font></b>
<br>
<br><img src="images/q6.jpg" alt="Img" height="442" width="568">
<br>
<br>Waxing is the most popular and traditional hair-removal technique that spas offer. Specialists put hot wax on the skin and then press a cotton strip tightly onto the wax. They then immediately pull off the strip and the excess hair comes off along with it. Waxing can done anywhere on the body like the chest, the back, the eyebrows, the legs, the upper-lip and bikini areas. Some spas have the facility of full Brazilian waxes, where all the hair from the genital area is cleared away.
<br>
<br><b><font color=maroon>Medical Treatments</font></b>
<br>
<br><img src="images/q7.jpg" alt="Img" height="442" width="568">
<br>
<br>Although these services are not available at every spa, more and more spas are coming up with these every day. These treatments include Microdermabrasion, CACI face-lifts, Botox, Restylane, Juvederm, laser hair removal etc. Microdermabrasion is process that microcrystal to cut off the outer layer of the dead skill cells from the surface of the skin. CACI face-lifts use electronic equipment to firm facial muscles, which reduces the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, firms loose and sagging skin, makes the lips appear pouty, and lifts up baggy eyes. Botox, Restylane and Juvederm are all injections that reduce the common signs of aging such as frown lines, crow's feet, wrinkles etc. Laser hair removal uses laser beams to permanently remove hair from all over the body
